DEVELOPER: Matt Granger

This app is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface (LIRI). 

You can make specific requests for data by using **key words** to retreive that data. In this app, the data encompasses entertainment. You can search for songs, artists, concerts, and movies. 

Let's overview the app and discuss instructions on how to use LIRI: 

KEY WORDS: 
* concert-this 
* spotify-this-song 
* movie-this
* do-what-it-says

Since this is a backend app, you will need to run *npm install* in order to use the app.
Once that is done, you can now return to your terminal and begin to type *node liri.js* 

--Wait! Now is the time to use one of our key words. Let's finish the line by typing *movie-this*

You should have typed: *node liri.js movie-this*. 

Go ahead and execute the code, you will see the default movie is called Mr. Nobody. The app should return helpful information about the movie data object. You can now try to search for a movie on your own! 

The same logic will follow our other command lines using our key words. 

Running *concert-this* [insert artist name!] will return upcoming events/concerts by the artist

Running *spotify-this-song* [insert song name!] will return the song, artists, album name.

Running *do-what-it-says* will return random data about a song. Use this to get used to the app's functionality.
